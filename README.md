# Wireless Logic Assignment

## Test Description

This task is intended to test your ability to consume a webpage, process some data and present it.
While there is no specific time limit, we would not expect you to spend any longer than 2 hours
completing this.

We are looking for concise, testable, clean, well commented code and that you have chosen the
right tools for the right job. We will also be looking at your app structure as a whole.

Using best practice coding methods, build a console application that scrapes the following website
url https://wltest.dns-systems.net/ and returns a JSON array of all the product options on the page.
Each element in the JSON results array should contain ‘option title, ‘description’, ‘price’ and
‘discount’ keys corresponding to items in the table. The items should be ordered by annual price
with the most expensive package first.
